Applications:

* Google Chrome + devtools
* git cli + git gui (or any decent GUI tool for git - makes it easier to commit parts of files rather than the whole thing)
* Docker for Mac
* docker-compose
* Visual Studio Code + various extensions
* AWS CLI
* Slack
* MS Teams
* pgAdmin4 (Postgres admin tool - but not as good as others for development)
* Java (AdoptOpenJDK OpenJ9 versions 8LTS and 11LTS, others for trying out new Java features)
* JetBrains Toolbox, providing:
  * IntelliJ Ultimate (frontend often only needs WebStorm)
  * Datagrip (database tool based on IntelliJ - but dbeaver or similar is fine)
* Postman / Insomnia (testing ReST APIs etc)


Tools:
* Node Version Manager
* p7zip
* wget
* watch (monitor )
